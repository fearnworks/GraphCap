===========================
Perspectives in GraphCap
===========================

A perspective in GraphCap is a unique approach to analyzing and captioning images. Each perspective provides a different way of understanding and describing visual content, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of images.

Key Concepts
============

- **Structured Analysis**: Perspectives use structured data models to ensure consistent and detailed analysis.
- **Configurable Outputs**: Each perspective can generate various output formats, such as JSON, HTML, and network diagrams.

Usage
=====

Perspectives are implemented as nodes in the GraphCap DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflow. They process images and produce structured outputs that can be further used for dataset creation or analysis.

Example Perspectives
====================

1. **GraphCaption**: Provides a structured analysis of images with categorized tags and descriptions, focusing on comprehensive scene understanding.
2. **ArtCritic**: Offers artistic analysis of images, focusing on composition, technique, and aesthetic qualities.
